# CheckIp

A simple "What Is My IP Address?" lookup service.

# Background

This is a "What Is My IP Address?" lookup service.

It finds and shows your IP address information.

This project started out as "pretty IP" - a pretty way to display IP information. Pretty is overrated.

This is a much more lean version, in NodeJs.

# Roadmap

- Convert ISO-3166-2 country code to country name.
- Add DNSBL
- Reverse DNS (IP to Hostname)
